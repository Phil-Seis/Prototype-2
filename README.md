# Prototype 2 - Hungry Animals game using Unity and C#

Overview

This game is a fast-paced top-down game where players must throw food to stop stampeding animals from running past them. The goal is to survive as long as possible by keeping the animals at bay using quick reflexes and strategic food-throwing.

This project demonstrates essential Unity and programming concepts, making it a great resource for learning game development basics or expanding your Unity skills.

Features
Player Control: Maneuver your character around the screen to aim and throw food at incoming animals.
Projectile Mechanics: Launch food projectiles to interact with the animals and keep them from passing.
Dynamic Gameplay:
Randomized animal spawns for unpredictable and exciting challenges.
Increasing difficulty as more animals spawn over time.
Collision Detection: Real-time interactions between animals, food, and the player.
Reusable Prefabs: Efficiently spawn animals and projectiles using Unity prefabs.
Score Tracking: Keep track of your performance as you fend off the stampede.

Technologies and Concepts Used
This game leverages key programming and Unity features, including:
If-then statements: For game logic and conditional behaviors.
Random value generation: To create varied and engaging gameplay.
Arrays: To manage multiple game objects like animals and projectiles.
Collision detection: To handle interactions between objects.
Prefabs: To maintain consistency and reduce development overhead.
Instantiation: To dynamically generate game objects during runtime.

How to Play
Objective: Stop the animals from reaching the bottom of the screen by throwing food at them.
Controls: Use the arrow keys or WASD to move the player and the spacebar or mouse click to throw food.
Scoring: Earn points for every animal you stop. The game ends when too many animals pass you.
